regular algorithms need create different algorithm everything want computer want computer play chess explain play chess want complete medical diagnosis give rules diagnosis machine learning algorithm knows nothing chess breast cancer can learn things going appropriate data machine learning algorithms master algorithms make algorithms question course general can algorithm can make one learning algorithm learn absolutely anything happens five different paradigms machine learning master algorithm approach learning anything data one approach reverse engineer brain behind deep learning neural networks idea brain greatest learning algorithm can try reverse engineer computer another approach simulate evolution computer evolution created just brain life earth perhaps greatest learning algorithm earth think implementing computer another approach based reasoning high level like scientists formulating hypothesis testing refining another approach based bayesian statistics using probability bayes theorem decide probability hypothesis true final one reading analogy something intuitive people time faced new situation try find similarities situations occurred take solutions one can learn tribes tribes solving one important problem machine learning symbolists tribe employs scientist reasoning something important learn pieces knowledge example form rules can composed arbitrary ways create many different chains reasoning different source originally learned type compositionality important things like understanding language compositional reasoning connectionists neural networks brain inspired learning know solve creative assignment problem system lots different parameters deciding responsible errors fix things system lot moving parts obvious connectionists algorithm called backpropagation solves problem evolutionaries know learn structure connectionists think brain structure already defined happens strength synapses change learn remember things evolutionaries know learn structure scratch can actually build things like radios programs robots starting piles parts bayesians know deal uncertainty knowledge learned data uncertain never sure something true generalize generalization might wrong bayesians use probability probabilistic inference machinery allows correctly update probability hypothesis true finally analogizers know something nobody else learn across different domains little data days lot emphasis big data take example new job data one two instances humans however good taking everything previous experience applying new domain famous example niels bohr first quantum theory atom based analogy atom solar system one tribes something unique know can take can unify one master algorithm important tribes tends focus problem think master algorithm thing problems real don master algorithm solve five really need unification five algorithms truly master algorithm sense re looking grand unified theory machine learning like standard model great unified theory physics far developing master algorithm ways re far ve step step ve able unify symbolism bayesian thought ve able unify symbolism analogy based learning example learning algorithms use evolutionary learning structure use connectionist learning parameters whatnot ve actually made good progress think day far will actually full unification five things big question however will done people think ll done suspicion addition five major ideas others yet discovered someone going discover ways think will easier someone professional machine learning scientist tend think along tracks tribes re member one goals writing book get people thinking machine learning maybe one will idea re missing tell us time ics study professor emeritus dennis kibler joined uc irvine 1992 graduated 1997 ph machine learning reason came uc irvine ph time actually one large machine learning groups anywhere departments didn machine learning group back maybe one faculty member pursuing machine learning uc irvine whole bunch decided definitively machine learning field applied uc irvine got dennis actually teaching introductory machine learning course graduate students thesis grew project class ics impact current work learned machine learning still using today methodology ideas learned machine learning changed grown immensely last 20 years lot fundamental things learned ics still apply terms learning algorithms five paradigms terms experimental methodology uc irvine one places methodologies originated still using teaching students drew machine learning originally got interested artificial intelligence undergraduate student kind accidental just saw book called artificial intelligence intrigued might read book back 80s one chapter machine learning immediately thought two things one machine learning really crucial thing can learn ll never anything intelligent can learn rest will follow just look people robot spent years programming robot doesn learn good person day month later person will much intelligent can will sorts amazing consequences applications second saw state art time primitive meant contribute better go field immature mature field like physics biology mathematics much harder make contribution combination machine learning becomes seductive field convinced time machine learning going take world one day told people scary thing actually taking world go post ics originally portugal attended uc irvine fulbright scholarship requires return country two years professor lisbon got job university washington ve since advice offer graduating students something applies undergraduates graduate students enormous impact computer science today don just think along existing tracks lot things easy harm biggest opportunities today apply computer science unsolved problems think example uber huge company now apply information technology problem finding cabs doesn sound like big deal think zillow revolutionizing real estate market somebody thought applying computer science go list point graduate just taking job established company although fine thinking open opportunities think many story courtney hamilton 6210 donald bren hall irvine
